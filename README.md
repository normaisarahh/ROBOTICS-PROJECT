# ROBOTICS-PROJECT
This project involves analysing the motion of a 3DOF SCARA robot using Forward Kinematics (FK) and Inverse KInematics (IK) approaches. The goal is to model and stimulate joint movements using Simulink/Simscape and to compare the result with analytical solutions to evaluate accuracy and robot behavior.
